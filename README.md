### Hi there, I'm Pierre 👋

- 🌱 I’m a final-year MSc Software Engineering student at KTH, specializing in Distributed Systems.

- ⚡ I'm passionate about web app development and user-friendly interfaces, proficient in JavaScript, Java, Python, among many other things.

- 🧑‍🎓 Currently learning Rust

- 🔭 I have been central in building the roughly 1M SEK private cloud enabling innovation at KTH with free cloud computing for students and researchers. I’ve also had the great privilege to talk at conferences and contribute to the open source projects used. [kthcloud](https://github.com/kthcloud)

- 📺 I’m currently doing my Master’s thesis in the area of live video broadcasting over the internet, researching the integration of dedicated hardware accelerators in Kubernetes-based cloud-native broadcasting pipelines.

- 👀 From August 2024, I’m open to opportunities in dynamic environments, where I can grow as a software developer and make a meaningful impact.

### Some personal projects

#### [hempriser.se](https://hempriser.se) - Property price predictor for Sweden
Hempriser is born from the absence of a public API from Hemnet, and involves intricate web scraping, data cleaning, and machine learning model training to predict property prices. [See the code](https://github.com/pierrelefevre/hempriser)

#### [åt.se](https://xn--t-1fa.se/) — AI generated news summary
**Exciting news!** åt.se has won Schibsted’s Power of Journalism Scholarship! [Read more](https://schibsted.com/news/they-are-the-winners-of-schibsteds-power-of-journalism-scholarship/)

To play around with, and learn more about LLMs, I created åt.se, a web
page where all the content is scraped and summarized by LLMs. The goal
is to have multiple sources for each news story, avoiding the writer’s bias. [See the code](https://github.com/pierrelefevre/at_se)

#### [orc.fyi](https://orc.fyi/) — Course search and review platform
Finding elective courses that are interesting can be challenging. orc.fyi is
a web platform allowing students to search for courses across multiple
Swedish universities, and review them after taking the course to help
future students.
