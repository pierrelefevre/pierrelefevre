### Hi there, I'm Pierre ðŸ‘‹
### Here are some of my personal projects

#### [hempriser.se](https://hempriser.se) - Property price predictor for Sweden
Hempriser is born from the absence of a public API from Hemnet, and involves intricate web scraping, data cleaning, and machine learning model training to predict property prices. [See the code](https://github.com/pierrelefevre/hempriser)

#### [Ã¥t.se](https://xn--t-1fa.se/) â€” AI generated news summary
**Exciting news!** Ã¥t.se has won Schibstedâ€™s Power of Journalism Scholarship! [Read more](https://schibsted.com/news/they-are-the-winners-of-schibsteds-power-of-journalism-scholarship/)

To play around with, and learn more about LLMs, I created Ã¥t.se, a web
page where all the content is scraped and summarized by LLMs. The goal
is to have multiple sources for each news story, avoiding the writerâ€™s bias. [See the code](https://github.com/pierrelefevre/at_se)

#### [orc.fyi](https://orc.fyi/) â€” Course search and review platform
Finding elective courses that are interesting can be challenging. orc.fyi is
a web platform allowing students to search for courses across multiple
Swedish universities, and review them after taking the course to help
future students.
