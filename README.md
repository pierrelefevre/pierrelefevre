### Hi there, I'm Pierre ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a final-year MSc Software Engineering student at KTH, specializing in Distributed Systems.

- ðŸ‘¯ I'm currently open to thesis opportunities in spring 2024, focused on Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing, or other interesting fields in software engineering. 

- âš¡ I'm passionate about web app development and user-friendly interfaces, proficient in JavaScript, Java, Python, among many other things. 

- ðŸ”­ For the last two years, I've been working on building a cloud computing service for KTH from the ground up, focusing on empowering students and researchers with adequate computing power. This project has been rather successful, with many researchers migrating over their ML tasks, and courses using the cloud enabling students to gain real world experience with cloud computing.

### Current personal projects

#### [Ã¥t.se](https://xn--t-1fa.se/) â€” AI generated news summary
**Exciting news** - Ã¥t.se has won the Schibstedâ€™s Power of Journalism Scholarship! [Read more](https://schibsted.com/news/they-are-the-winners-of-schibsteds-power-of-journalism-scholarship/)

To play around with, and learn more about LLMs, I created Ã¥t.se, a web
page where all the content is scraped and summarized by LLMs. The goal
is to have multiple sources for each news story, avoiding the writerâ€™s bias. [See the code](https://github.com/pierrelefevre/at_se)

#### [orc.fyi](https://orc.fyi/) â€” Course search and review platform
Finding elective courses that are interesting can be challenging. orc.fyi is
a web platform allowing students to search for courses across multiple
Swedish universities, and review them after taking the course to help
future students. An LLM chat bot is also available for a more natural
interaction like that of a guidance counselor.
